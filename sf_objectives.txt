LANDING: intro to site, explains what it is and what it does, button to register account and start demo

REGISTER: form, lore blurb re: starting your journey from this point

FIRST LOGIN: form, lore blurb re: how your journey will begin

CHOICE PAGES: choose region and starter

LOGIN: form, lore blurb re: coming back to continue journey (will only be seen by users returning to demo after completing demo tutorial)

YOUR HOMEPAGE: start with exciting animation, exciting lore blurb, cool logo, bring user to their lair page, assign random starter, load region BG and starter from database
, give them 3 options:
        
        1. EQUIP: let users test equip system, put item on starter pet
                >> NEED: vector resource for the equippable item, item equip system and interface
        2. EXPLORE: let users explore a small map and acquire an item (option to go to equip and swap out starter item)
                >> NEED: interactive map game (see Sylestia fest map), vector or pixel resources 
        3. CUSTOMIZATION: let users change one gene pattern on their starter
                >> NEED: art resources for color and pattern change, interface for changing and saving changes to pet art
                >> 3 starter genes with color selectors
                
        NEED for homepage: background img resources for each region, vector resources for themed environment elements  
        ADD dropdowns on equip and custom pages to load specific unicorns
        ADD show page for unicorn, with buttons to go to equip and custom
        
        Pages with dynamic content: lair page, equip/custom/inventory pages, content of map (use loops?)
        
        >> backdrop toggles affect div containing unicorn image
        
        >> ADD INDEX PAGE with all registered users so players can visit each others pages
        
FIND OUT:
X how to generate incremented ID numbers per pet and companions (NOT mongodb id strings) (TEST auto-increment plugin)
how to increment level (use auto-increment plugin if it works for id; how to increment at reaching level marker?)
how to keep track of hunger and energy and display changes
how to generate images and image changes (equipping, customizing, etc)
how to layer and store equipped items on image
how to change and store colors and markings
how to do FR style bio box (form that loads on same page [asynchronously?])
how to change backgrounds from db on show page
how to load homepage bg based on user region
how to display "none" for parents of gen 1s, how to display parents for bred unicorns (if statement?)
how to let users vist each others lairs (use middleware to check ownership and display or not display appropriate buttons)
how to have url on home pages reflect user id and/or unicorn id (NOT objectId) based on which user/unicorn you're viewing (like FR and gryffs)

On islands of sturdy cypress trees, and on clusters of floating flat-bottomed boats, herds of unicorns make their homes. Unicorns of this realm are relaxed and adventurous.",
