# sunflame_mountain

After completing Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy, I wanted to build something eye-catching, something that would stand out. So, I took the basic concepts I'd learned from the YelpCamp project in that course and went in my own direction with it. 

I created a list of features that I wanted the site to have, and then I went over that list and determined what I would need to learn in order to make those features a reality. This project is the culmination of that process. 

I went wherever the process took me: I wanted a platformer minigame on the site, so I researched Javascript game frameworks, decided to go with Phaser, and joined a Phaser bootcamp; when Phaser 3 ultimately lacked the tools to give me the specific gameplay functionality I was looking for, I found a plugin for Phaser CE that would do the job and made the decision that switching to Phaser CE would be the best course of action. I expanded on all the concepts I'd learned, going far beyond the scope of the bootcamps I took: I built a ledge-climbing system in Phaser CE, and created a character customization and equipping system in Javascript with Konva and sharp.I gained experience in contributing to issues on GitHub: I found a bug in the sharp library and in a Phaser plugin, and participated in correcting both. 

I'm proud of what I have learned with this project and I'm looking forward to learning and building more.
